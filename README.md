3D Transformation Visualizer

An interactive and visually rich application built using Python and Pygame to demonstrate core concepts of linear algebra and 3D computer graphics.

The system allows real-time visualization of 3D objects under various transformations such as rotation, scaling, translation, and shearing, along with advanced mathematical concepts like eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
